# Photo-Synth-Hyper-Sonic
A project I initialy worked on with some high school friends, that shifted into a solo project.

This project started as Photo Synth, a movement shooter I designed with some highschool buddies that wanted to get into game development.

It turned out that 4 guys with little to no experience in gamedev and/or working in a team, made for a bad team. We scrapped the project about a month into development, but I thought the bones could be useful so I continued working on it on my own as Hyper Sonic.

Unfortunately my motivation dwindled as scope creep snuck up on me, but I am proud of what I managed and the game design elements I tinkered with.

Here is a screenshot of the latest prototype build:

It seems to me I misplaced the assets of this project (models & animations), however there where some builds I mamanged to scavange, so peruse through them at your own leisure.
